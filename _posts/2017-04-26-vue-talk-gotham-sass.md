---

I gave a talk at [GothamSass](https://www.meetup.com/gothamsass/events/239327017/) titled [Improving interactivity for legacy front-end applications using Vue.js](http://musicismath.net/vue-js-talk/#/) for which there are [slides available](http://musicismath.net/vue-js-talk/#/) which contain links to some [CodePen examples](http://musicismath.net/vue-js-talk/#/4/9) of basic Vue functionality.
